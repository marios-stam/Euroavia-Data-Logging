# The Rocket Project
EUROAVIA is an organization that stands out thanks to its technical and scientific division. It all started in 2017, the first year our new AS started operations, that a few ambitious Engineering students begun the Rocket Project. They created the professional and team environment that our members enjoy working in today.
